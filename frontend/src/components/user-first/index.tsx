              We are user-centric. Our teams find solutions to real problems they've validated before. And they rule out bad ideas through experiments. 
              The good ideas are then built in an agile manner.
            </p>

            <p> 
              Teams work either on problem spaces provided by our partner companies or they tackle their own problems as a so-called »Wild Team«.
