                In order to find a problem that is worth solving, the teams
                explore their problem spaces first. They think about who might
                have a problem and go out to verify it.

                Once the teams identify several problems they decide which one
                provides the biggest opportunity. Often, this is the time for
                first experiments.

                At this stage, promising solutions are tested and narrowed down,
                allowing students to find out which solution to build. And
                during building further testing ensures the product is build the
                right way.
