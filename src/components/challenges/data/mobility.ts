The process is powered by the best-in-class tools and methods from Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and agile product development. But they don't just develop the idea, they actually build a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) that they <b>LAUNCH</b> and test with real users in real life in order to gain insights and optimize it.",
